# Overview

Cheesy Dad is a joke telling Android application, which serves **random combination of background color, pattern and joke** after pressing button on the main screen.

Used Gradle to build a joke-telling app that has both a **free and paid version**. 
This included **factoring functionality into libraries** as well as using **build flavors** to modularize the construction of each variant of the app. I also configured a **Google Cloud Endpoints** development server to supply the jokes.
